# Advent of Code 2025 — Ruby Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for **[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)**, implemented in **Ruby**.

Each day’s puzzle is organized in its own folder and includes:

- `input.txt` — the puzzle input
- `part_x_solution.rb` — the script containing the solution logic

## Running Solutions

To run a specific solution for a specific day and specific part:

```bash
ruby x_day/part_X_solution.rb
```
